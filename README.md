Unfortunately the packaging org have been deactivated by Salesforce and with it all package versions. Therefore it is not possible to install the package from AppExchange. 

You can try out the new standard Flow Button component https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.fsc_flow_ref_elements_screencmp_screenbutton.htm&type=5. If the standard action does not work for you, here is source code to the custom [Flow Navigation Button](https://github.com/Step-Labs-Sf/flow-button).

Without the partner org I don't have access to the AppExchange listing, therefore I am not able to remove it.
