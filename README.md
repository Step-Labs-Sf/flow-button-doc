Unfortunately the packaging org have been deactivated by Salesforce and with it all package versions. Therefore it is not possible to install the package from AppExchange. 

You can try out the new standard Flow Button component https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.fsc_flow_ref_elements_screencmp_screenbutton.htm&type=5.
